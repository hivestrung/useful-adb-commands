# Useful ADB Commands

A collection of adb commands for modifying your phone and de-bloating/removing bloat (especially for Samsung devices)

Before using this, ensure you have ADB installed on your computer, and adb debugging enabled (Google how to do this if you're not sure)

The reason for me creating this is that I just got a Samsung Galaxy S10 and it can be somewhat restrictive and very full of nonsense applications that we may not need but can't remove.

I'll add to this whenever I discover something that irks me that I need solved.
