# The Samsung Galaxy S10 (and perhaps some other models) have Facebook installed as a system app.
# This means you can't just uninstall it from your phone. You can only disable it.
# Until now. Ensure adb is installed, adb debugging on your Android is enabled, connect via USB to your computer, launch Terminal/whatever and use the following commands

adb shell
pm uninstall --user 0 com.facebook.services
pm uninstall --user 0 com.facebook.katana
pm uninstall --user 0 com.facebook.system
pm uninstall --user 0 com.facebook.appmanager

# This does not uninstall Facebook Messenger. The package for Facebook Messenger is com.facebook.orca.

# When you're on adb shell, to see the installed Facebook packages: 
pm list package | grep facebook
